## How to use this image


## Maintaining this Build

When a new version is released, please make a git commit with the modified version in the VERSION file and the corresponding tag with format "vx.x.x".


## Configuration of automated build with docker hub

- add a hooks/build file containing the bash script with docker-compose build
- retag the image (in the bash script) to ${IMAGE_NAME} for docker hub to find the built image afterward
- in automated build configuration, specify a dummy file as dockerfile. It wont be used but must exist.
